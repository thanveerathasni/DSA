# Searching Algorithm

## What is it?
A searching algorithm is a method used to find a specific element or value inside a collection like an array or list.

## Why is it used?
- To find data efficiently
- To avoid checking unnecessary elements
- To improve performance in applications

## How does it work?
- It compares the target value with elements in the data structure
- Based on the algorithm, it may check one-by-one or divide the data into parts

## When is it used?
- When you need to locate a value
- When validating user input
- When filtering or matching data

## Where is it used?
- Search bars
- Login systems (finding users)
- Databases
- E-commerce product search
- Backend APIs

## Common Examples
- Searching a number in an array
- Finding a user by email
- Checking if a value exists

## Types of Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Exponential Search

## Key Point
Choosing the right searching algorithm depends on:
- Data size
- Whether data is sorted
