# Linear Search

## What is Linear Search?
Linear Search is a searching algorithm that checks each element in an array one by one until the target value is found or the array ends.

## Why is it used?
- Simple to understand and implement
- Works on unsorted arrays
- No extra memory required

## How does it work?
1. Start from the first element
2. Compare each element with the target
3. Stop when a match is found
4. If no match, return -1

## When should we use it?
- When the data size is small
- When the array is not sorted
- When simplicity is more important than speed

## Where is it used?
- Searching user input
- Small datasets
- Validation checks
- Basic filtering logic

## Time Complexity
- Best case: O(1)
- Worst case: O(n)

## Example
Array: [10, 5, 8, 3, 9]  
Target: 8  
Output: Index 2
