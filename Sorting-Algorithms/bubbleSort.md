# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## What is Bubble Sort?
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Large elements move to the end of the array like bubbles rising in water.

---

## Why is it called Bubble Sort?
Because bigger values slowly "bubble up" to the end of the list after each pass.

---

## How Bubble Sort Works
1. Start from the first element
2. Compare it with the next element
3. Swap if the first is bigger
4. Move to the next pair
5. Repeat the process for multiple passes
6. Stop when the array is sorted

## Example
Input:
[5, 1, 4, 2]

After sorting:
[1, 2, 4, 5]

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Best Case: O(n²)
- Average Case: O(n²)

---

## Space Complexity
- O(1) (in-place sorting)

---

## Advantages
- Very easy to understand
- Good for learning logic
- No extra memory needed

---

## Disadvantages
- Very slow for large data
- Not used in real-world large applications

---

## When to Use Bubble Sort?
- For learning purposes
- For very small datasets
- To understand sorting fundamentals
