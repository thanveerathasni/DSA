# Recursion – Theory

## 1. What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

## 2. Why Recursion is needed?
Some problems are easier to solve by breaking them into smaller similar problems.

## 3. Mandatory rules of Recursion
Every recursive function must have:
1. Base Case – stopping condition
2. Recursive Case – function calling itself with smaller input

## 4. How Recursion works?
Each function call is stored in the call stack.
When base case is reached, stack starts returning values.

## 5. Loop vs Recursion
Loop repeats code using for/while.
Recursion repeats by function calls.

## 6. Advantages
- Clean code
- Best for tree and divide problems

## 7. Disadvantages
- More memory usage
- Stack overflow risk

## 8. When to use Recursion?
- Factorial
- Fibonacci
- Tree traversal

## 9. When not to use?
- Simple counting
- Performance critical code
